This article was originally published <a href=https://medium.com/selleo/writing-a-regular-expression-tester-in-crystal-as-a-learning-exercise-481935d6672f>here</a>.</p><h2 id=boring-introduction>Boring introduction</h2><p>As a part-time Rubyist, I couldn&rsquo;t ignore <a href=https://crystal-lang.org/>Crystal</a> any longer (+ I enjoy learning new programming languages) so I decided to give it a try. Because I wanted to write something useful and contribute to the community, I was looking for a small idea in the Ruby world and spoiler alert… I found it.</p><p>One of my favourite online tools is <a href=https://rubular.com/>Rubular</a> - a regular expression tester for Ruby so I&rsquo;ve decided to make a copy of it for Crystal because every programming language needs one.</p><h2 id=notes-about-regexengine>Notes about regex engine</h2><p>Crystal uses <a href=http://www.pcre.org/>PCRE</a> which is a C library for regular expressions. For a contrast, Ruby uses Onigmo library (since 2.x). There are few differences that are worth mentioning between Crystal integration of PCRE and regex library itself.</p><p>Firstly, PCRE offers support for other encodings but Crystal strings are UTF-8 only, therefore regular expressions must be UTF-8 too.</p><p>Secondly, one of the regex options in Crystal is a multiline match denoted by <code>"m"</code> flag that translates into a combination of two separate options in PCRE:</p><ul><li><strong>PCRE_DOTALL</strong> - changes the behavior of <code>.</code> in regex</li><li><strong>PCRE_MULTILINE</strong> - changes the behavior of <code>^</code> and <code>$</code> in regex</li></ul><p>FYI, Ruby does it too in its own engine.</p><h2 id=implementation>Implementation</h2><p>While working on the project I wanted to add some minor tweaks that would improve, in my opinion, your <em>&ldquo;regular expression testing experience&rdquo;</em>. Here is the list of what I had planned:</p><ul><li><p>improved whitespace characters display and turned on by default (every space/tab/newline is rendered as a special character in a different color)</p></li><li><p>clearer distinction when matched strings are next to each other (matches are highlighted with rounded corners selection)</p></li><li><p>extended reference sheet by adding examples like &ldquo;positive lookbehind&rdquo; because who remembers that syntax? (not me, I need to google it every time)</p></li></ul><p>Once my goals were set, I had to choose web framework and I had a couple options here: <a href=https://amberframework.org/>Amber</a>, <a href=https://luckyframework.org/>Lucky</a> and <a href=https://kemalcr.com/>Kemal</a>. I went with Kemal as it seemed like a no-brainer, considering the size of the application (two endpoints, one view). Deployment to Heroku was also a breeze thanks to the existing <a href=https://github.com/crystal-lang/heroku-buildpack-crystal>buildpack</a>.</p><p>Because of the statically type-checked nature of the language doing TDD requires a bit different approach especially, if you declare your types explicitly - sometimes you just need to write some dummy code in the method just to make compilation successful. The same affects <code>nils</code>, crystal will know if your code results in <code>nil</code> so the compilation process might fail, but that&rsquo;s just Crystal having your back and protecting you from unhandled exceptions.</p><p>There were a few occasions when I had to intensively browse the code in GitHub to understand Kemal or Crystal standard library but this is a part of the learning process so I am fine with it. Also, these projects are still young, at that stage, it&rsquo;s pretty normal.</p><p>Things I wish to see improved are better support for specs, it&rsquo;s quite ok now but I guess <a href=https://github.com/rspec>RSpec</a> spoiled me, and I am hoping for some solid debugging process.</p><p>The code can be found <a href=https://github.com/Selleo/crystular>here</a>.</p><h2 id=closing-thoughts>Closing thoughts</h2><p>After finishing the project, I was happy with the result and the things I&rsquo;ve learned. It was surprising how quickly you can transition to Crystal having a background in Ruby so if you are a Rubyist, I recommend you to try Crystal out.</p></div><aside class=article-aside><div class=aside-card><h4>Tags</h4><div class=tag-list><span class=tag>regex</span>
