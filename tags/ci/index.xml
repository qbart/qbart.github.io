      <description>This article was originally published here.
With the upcoming new GitHub Actions feature, I was very excited to test it, so I immediately signed up for the beta access and finally my invitation had been accepted.
The reason for my excitement mainly comes from my current project where I am mostly responsible for managing the infrastructure in AWS (Terraform) and backend development (Ruby on Rails) — if I have time for it.</description>
