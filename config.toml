My name is Bartłomiej Wójtowicz, but you can call me Bart for short.
I am currently the CTO at [Selleo Labs](https://selleo.com?utm_source=qbart.dev&utm_campaign=qbart.dev),
where we support our clients with business and software development.
As a passionate software engineer, I am always eager to learn new things and expand my knowledge. 
In my free time, I enjoy various hobbies such as recording sounds of nature, learn-playing the piano,
and honing my drawing skills. Animation enthusiast, both films and shows.
While I occasionally play video games, my true fascination lies in understanding the low-level magic that happens under the hood.
I am particularly interested in the areas of rendering, architecture, game design, AI, physics, and math. 
Together with my cousin, we run a small indie game development studio called [Soft Kiwi Games](https://softkiwi.games),
where we bring our passion for gaming and software development to life.
